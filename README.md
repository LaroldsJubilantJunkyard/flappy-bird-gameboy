# Flappy Bird (Completed)
This repository contains the final result of our [How to make Flappy Bird for Gameboy](https://laroldsjubilantjunkyard.com/tutorials/recreating-gameboy-games/flappy-bird/) tutorial. The tuorial is not yet updated for v1.0.0. The tutorial reflects the results of v0.5.0

## What is Included? What is NOT included?
The final product of the tutorial will not be a 1-for-1 mirror of the original flappy bird. v1.0.0 has a lot of the original features, that v0.5.0 did not have.

What IS included:

- Score Counter
- High Score Tracker 
- Medals for 10+, 20+, 30+, and 40+ points.
- One-button control scheme
- Pre-gameplay state
- Graphics – Bird, Pipes, and Background
- Basic Sounds – Fly, Score Increase, and Death
- Parallax Scrolling

Everything is made using The [2020 GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) and the C Programming Language.

The gameboy .gb ROM file can be created by running the make.bat file. The ROM file can be ran in a emulator like [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/).

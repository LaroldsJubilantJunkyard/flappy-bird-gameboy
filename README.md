# Flappy Bird (Completed)
This repository contains the final result of our [How to make Flappy Bird for Gameboy](https://laroldsjubilantjunkyard.com/tutorials/recreating-gameboy-games/flappy-bird/) tutorial. 

## What is Included? What is NOT included?
The final product of the tutorial will not be a 1-for-1 mirror of the original flappy bird. It’s important to point out which features are going to be included, and which will not. With That Said, here is what is NOT included:

The bird will not rotate when flying – The gameboy hardware does not support rotation.
- High Scores, Medals
- In-game advertisements

What IS included:

- Score Counter
- One-button control scheme
- Pre-gameplay state
- Graphics – Bird, Pipes, and Background
- Basic Sounds – Fly, Score Increase, and Death

Everything is made using The [2020 GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) and the C Programming Language.

The gameboy .gb ROM file can be created by running the make.bat file. The ROM file can be ran in a emulator like [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/).
